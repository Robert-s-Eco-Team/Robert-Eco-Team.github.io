# Robert's Eco Team
Robert's Eco Team is a project hosted for a comp known as YES (Young Entrepuers Scotland) Circular Economy Challenge in which we have to make an idea, turn it into
a local business and have the idea be as sustainable as possible! This project uses the idea of using waste (any preffered waste, mainly cotton or anything that has
cellulose inside) in science experiments so it can have a purpose instead of being disposed.
